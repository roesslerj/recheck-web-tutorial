// Here you can implement ignore rules for recheck in javascript.
// Please do not delete this file, even if it is empty.

// You can implement either of these two functions:
// shouldIgnoreElement(element)
// shouldIgnoreAttributeDifference(element, diff)

// You can find more details and example rules at: 
// https://retest.github.io/docs/recheck/how-ignore-works-in-recheck/
